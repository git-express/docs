# [git.express](https://git.express) - central place for your git activity

## Idea

You login using OAuth of one of the major git code hosting platforms (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) after that you can add any other OAuth capable hosting platform you use (self hosted gitlab, gogs etc). The activities on any of those connected platforms get displayed in one activity/PR/Issue list. Simple interactions (e.g. star, follow, (un)subscribe) should be possible directly on git.express anything needing further interaction (comment, merge, fork) should be linked to.

Got some ideas and/or wanna help implement? [Chime in on the issue section](https://github.com/morbidick/git.express/issues).

### Comfort features

* relogin with any of the connected major git platforms
* issue Kanban board
